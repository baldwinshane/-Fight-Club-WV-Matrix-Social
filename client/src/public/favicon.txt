Description: This is the favicon file for the Fight Club Matrix Social platform, a 32x32 pixel ICO image. The favicon features a stylized, anonymized icon representing the Fight Club WV community, designed to maintain the platform's secretive and intense aesthetic. The icon consists of a black silhouette of two fists raised in a fighting stance against a red background, with a subtle gray gradient to evoke a gritty, underground vibe. The design avoids any explicit text or identifiable symbols to ensure anonymity, aligning with Fight Club's privacy rules.

Note: As this is a binary ICO file, the actual content cannot be provided in text format. To generate this favicon, create a 32x32 pixel image with the described design using a tool like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or an online favicon generator (e.g., favicon.io), then convert it to ICO format. Place the file in the /client/public/ directory for use in index.html.
