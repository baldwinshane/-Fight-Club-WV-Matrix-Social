Description: This is the logo file for the Fight Club Matrix Social platform, a PNG image with dimensions approximately 200x200 pixels. The logo is anonymized to protect the Fight Club WV community's identity, featuring a stylized, abstract design of a clenched fist wrapped in bandages, rendered in shades of red (#dc2626, Tailwind red-600) and black (#111827, Tailwind gray-900). The background is transparent to allow flexible use across the platform (e.g., in the Home.js page or navigation bar). The design avoids any explicit text, names, or identifiable symbols, adhering to Fight Club's secrecy rules and maintaining a gritty, intense aesthetic.

Note: As this is a binary PNG file, the actual content cannot be provided in text format. To generate this logo, create an image with the described design using a tool like Adobe Illustrator, Canva, or GIMP, ensuring a transparent background and the specified dimensions. Save it as logo.png and place it in the /client/public/assets/ directory for use in components like Home.js or Settings.js.
